```

### **Check Form Visibility:**

```javascript
document.getElementById("apply").style.display;
// Before reading: "none"
// After reading: "block"

document.getElementById("readFirstMessage").style.display;
// Before reading: "block"
// After reading: "none"

## 🚨 Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Form visible immediately**

**Cause:** localStorage already set from previous test
**Fix:**

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### **Issue 2: Button not appearing at bottom**

**Cause:** Cached old version
**Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R or Cmd + Shift + R)

### **Issue 3: No redirect after confirmation**

**Cause:** JavaScript error
**Fix:** Check console for errors, verify `index.html` script is present

### **Issue 4: Form not showing after redirect**

**Cause:** JavaScript not detecting URL parameter
**Fix:** Verify URL includes `?guide=completed#apply`
