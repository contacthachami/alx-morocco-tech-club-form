```

2. **script.js** - Added Google Apps Script integration

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Form

### Step 1: Open Your Website Locally
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

### Step 2: Fill Out the Form
Fill in all required fields:
- ✅ Full name
- ✅ Age (16-100)
- ✅ Valid email address
- ✅ Phone number
- ✅ Current cohort
- ✅ Current program
- ✅ Hub location (radio button)
- ✅ Volunteer role (radio button)
- ✅ Time commitment (radio button)
- ✅ Motivation (minimum 10 characters)
- Optional: Previous experience
- Optional: Resource link

### Step 3: Submit and Verify
1. Click "Join Our Amazing Team"
2. You should see a success message
3. **Check your Google Sheet** - A new row should appear with:
   - Current timestamp
   - Unique submission ID
   - All form data

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Data Not Appearing in Google Sheet

**Solution 1: Check Apps Script Permissions**
1. Go to Google Apps Script editor
2. Click "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
3. Ensure "Who has access" is set to **"Anyone"**

**Solution 2: Check Browser Console**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Submit the form
4. Look for any error messages

**Solution 3: Test Apps Script Directly**
1. Open your Apps Script editor
2. Run the `testSubmission()` function
3. Check "Executions" for any errors
4. Check your Google Sheet for the test row

### Issue: CORS Errors

**Solution:**
The form uses `mode: "no-cors"` which is required for Google Apps Script. This is normal and expected.

### Issue: Form Validation Errors

**Check:**
- All required fields have values
- Email format is valid
- Age is between 16-100
- At least one radio button is selected in each group

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Email and phone format validation

### 🛡️ Additional Protection (Optional):

**Add Google reCAPTCHA:**
1. Get reCAPTCHA keys from Google
2. Add reCAPTCHA widget to form
3. Verify token in Apps Script

**Add Rate Limiting:**
```javascript
// In Apps Script, track submissions by IP/email
// Reject if too many submissions in short time
```

2. File → Download → Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)

### Share with Team:
1. Click "Share" in Google Sheet
2. Add team member emails
3. Set permissions (Viewer/Editor)

### Filter and Sort:
- Use Google Sheets filters on headers
- Sort by timestamp, role, location, etc.
- Create pivot tables for analytics

### Auto-Export (Optional):
Run the `exportSheetToXlsx()` function in Apps Script:
- Manually from editor
- Or set up a time-based trigger (daily/weekly)

## 🎯 What Happens When Someone Submits

1. **User fills form** → Clicks "Join Our Amazing Team"
2. **JavaScript validates** → Checks all required fields
3. **Data is sent** → POST request to Google Apps Script
4. **Apps Script receives** → Validates data again
5. **Data is saved** → New row added to Google Sheet
6. **User sees success** → Celebration animation plays! 🎉

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Email Notifications
Add to Apps Script to send confirmation emails:
```javascript
function sendConfirmationEmail(email, name) {
  MailApp.sendEmail({
    to: email,
    subject: "Welcome to ALX Tech Club!",
    body: "Hi " + name + ", we received your application..."
  });
}
```

### 2. WhatsApp Integration
Use WhatsApp Business API or services like:
- Twilio
- MessageBird
- WhatAPI

### 3. Duplicate Prevention
Check if email already exists before adding:
```javascript
function isDuplicate(email) {
  var data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  return data.some(row => row[4] === email); // Column E is email
}
```

### 4. Dashboard/Analytics
Create a separate sheet with:
- Total applications
- Applications by role
- Applications by hub
- Charts and graphs
