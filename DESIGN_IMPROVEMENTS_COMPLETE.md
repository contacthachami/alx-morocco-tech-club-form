## üí° Key Improvements Explained

### Why White Background?

The light purple gradient was too similar to the text colors, creating poor contrast. White background ensures maximum readability while maintaining the purple theme through borders, icons, and accent elements.

### Why Gradient Text Effect?

Makes the titles pop while keeping background clean. The gradient clips to the text, creating a modern, vibrant look that matches your brand.

### Why Larger Elements?

Bigger icons, circles, and text improve readability and give the section more visual weight. Users immediately notice the important "Before You Apply" workflow.

### Why Auto Print Dialog?

Removes confusion about how to get the PDF. User clicks button ‚Üí Dialog opens ‚Üí They select "Save as PDF" ‚Üí Done. Clear and direct.

### Why Force Colors in Print?

Browsers often strip backgrounds and colors when printing to save ink. The `!important` flags and `exact` color adjustment force all colors to print, ensuring the PDF looks exactly like the web page.

### Why Dark Text in PDF?

Even with color forcing, lighter gray text can be hard to read in PDFs. Dark colors (#1e293b, #0f172a) ensure professional readability on all devices and when printed physically.
