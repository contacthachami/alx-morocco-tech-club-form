# ✅ html2canvas Error - FIXED!

## 🔴 Error You Had

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: html2canvas is not defined
```

This happened on pages 2-7 because the code was trying to call `html2canvas` directly, but it's bundled inside html2pdf.js and not accessible as a global function.

## 🛠️ What I Fixed

Changed from **manual html2canvas calls** to **letting html2pdf.js handle everything**:

### ❌ BEFORE (Wrong Approach):

```javascript
// Tried to call html2canvas directly
html2canvas(pages[i], {...}).then(canvas => {
  // Manual processing
})
```

### ✅ AFTER (Correct Approach):

```javascript
// Create wrapper with all pages
const wrapper = document.createElement("div");
pages.forEach((page) => {
  wrapper.appendChild(page.cloneNode(true));
});

// Let html2pdf handle everything
html2pdf().set(opt).from(wrapper).save();
```

## 🎯 What Changed

1. **Removed** direct html2canvas calls (not accessible)
2. **Created** a wrapper div with all page clones
3. **Let html2pdf.js** handle the entire conversion process
4. **Simpler** and more reliable approach

## 🚀 How to Test Now

1. **Refresh** the page (Ctrl + R or F5)
2. **Open console** (F12)
3. **Click** "Download as PDF"
4. **Wait** 20-30 seconds
5. **Check console** - should NOT see "html2canvas is not defined" error

## 📊 Expected Console Output

You should now see:

```
