# Improved User Flow - Read Guide Implementation

## 🎯 Changes Summary

### ✅ Task 1: Move Confirmation Button to Bottom of Guide

**Before:**

- Button was at the TOP of `volunteer-guide.html` (line 19)
- Users could click without reading any content
- Poor user experience - no guarantee they read the guide

**After:**

- Button moved to the BOTTOM (after page 8 - Back Cover)
- Users MUST scroll through all 8 pages to reach the button
- Ensures users actually read the content before confirming

**Location:** After the back cover section, before the `<script>` tag

### ✅ Task 2: Update "Before You Apply" Section in index.html

**Changes Made:**

| Element           | Before                             | After                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Section Title** | "Download Guide Section"           | "Read Guide Section"                     |
| **Header Icon**   | `fa-file-pdf` (PDF icon)           | `fa-book-open` (Book icon)               |
| **Intro Text**    | "Download our comprehensive..."    | "Read our comprehensive..."              |
| **Step 1 Title**  | "Download Guide"                   | "Read Guide"                             |
| **Step 1 Text**   | "Get our volunteer roles PDF"      | "Explore our volunteer roles"            |
| **Step 2 Title**  | "Read & Choose"                    | "Confirm Reading"                        |
| **Step 2 Text**   | "Explore roles that match you"     | "Verify you understand the roles"        |
| **Button Icon**   | `fa-download` (Download icon)      | `fa-book-reader` (Reading icon)          |
| **Button Text**   | "Download Volunteer Guide"         | "Read Volunteer Guide"                   |
| **Button Hint**   | "Use browser Print to PDF"         | "Read all pages carefully"               |
| **Note Text**     | "Click the Download as PDF button" | "Read all pages, then click I Have Read" |

2. **User clicks "Read Volunteer Guide"**

   - Opens `volunteer-guide.html` in new tab
   - No button visible at the top
   - User starts reading from Page 1 (Cover)
